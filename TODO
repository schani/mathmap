*** TODO Sharing of filters via CouchDB				    :feature:
** General
*** TODO Rework the whole coordinate-transformation thing	   :simplify:
    Use a -1 to 1 coordinate system natively, but for square pixels.
    For non-square images, make the shorter edge go from -1 to 1, the
    longer edge will go beyond.

    That way, we can get completely rid of the whole resizing stuff.
    Although, maybe we'll want an image attribute which makes the
    longer edge be -1 to 1, which again would require resizing.  Leave
    it out at first, though.

    The only way in which a filter's =xy= would now depend on the size
    of the canvas or its image arguments would be for pixel filters,
    for which =xy= would be =xy*max(pixel_width*pixel_height)=
** Language
*** TODO sqrt for complex					       :feature:
** Compiler
*** TODO The pixel-size simplifier must be updated			:bug:
    Simply use the canvas size.  The "compositing with opacity"
    filters should then simplify to only fetch two pixels and should
    be just as fast as the native versions.
*** DONE Top-level filters taking images should never use the pixel-size internals :simplify:
    CLOSED: [2009-08-16 Sun 23:45]
    Instead they should bind =IMAGE_PIXEL_WIDTH/HEIGHT(first_image)=
    to =__canvasPixelW/H=.  Only if a filter doesn't take an input
    image should it use those builtins directly.  That will allow the
    compiler to further simplify more code, like the "compositing with
    opacity" filters.

    Wrong, we must always use the canvas pixel-size internals, because
    our brain-dead coordinate system stretches pixels so that the
    canvas always goes from -1 to 1 in both directions.  If we use a
    different pixel-size for a closure, its pixels are stretched
    differently which screws things up.
*** DONE Add pixel-size arguments to closure			   :simplify:
    CLOSED: [2009-08-16 Sun 23:48]
    That simplifies cc.c and llvm.c (they both with deal with the
    pixel-size issue separately), and it makes the simplifier trivial.

    Wrong, see [[*Top-level filters taking images should][above]].
*** TODO Loop-invariant code motion does not honor non-pure ops		:bug:
*** TODO Transform as many optimizations to use the simplifier 	   :simplify:
*** TODO Simplify coordinate stuff (non-stretched ident filter) :performance:feature:
*** TODO don't produce functions for filters which have been optimized away :performance:
*** DONE We need something to handle loop-invariant conditional closures :bug:
    CLOSED: [2009-08-16 Sun 17:45]
Obsoleted by [[*caching of native filter results]].

Consider this code:

#+BEGIN_SRC mathmap
while ... do
  cond = ...;
  if cond then
    img = gaussian_blur(abc)
  else
    img = gaussian_blur(def)
  end;
  p = img(xy)
end
#+END_SRC

If =cond= is not loop-invariant then we cannot move the =if= statement
out of the loop, and neither of the invocations of =gaussian_blur=,
which means that for every pixel we will render either one or the
other.

We need a lazy evaluation operation that makes sure that the rendering
happens only once.  Something that transforms the above code to:

#+BEGIN_SRC mathmap
img_true = lazy(gaussian_blur(abc));
img_false = lazy(gaussian_blur(def));
while ... do
  cond = ...;
  if ... then
    img = force(img_true)
  else
    img = force(img_false)
  end;
  p = img(xy)
end
#+END_SRC

The =lazy= operation would create a kind of closure which =force=
would invoke at most once and then store and reuse the result.  Of
course =lazy= would only be used for expensive operations.

    It's very confusing and is an issue with both WinGimp as well as
    the self-compiled GIMP in MSys.  If the self-compiled GIMP is
    started from the MathMap source directory, it works.  If it (or
    WinGimp) is started from the WinGimp's ~/.gimp-2.6/plug-ins
    directory (with complete MathMap installation), it doesn't work.
    If either one is started within MSys from /bin, they work.  If
    /bin is copied to /bim, neither one works there.

    The function should return at least two numbers, namely the
    coordinates of the center of the cell that was queried.  Ideally
    it would also return a number "identifying" the cell, so that one
    could for example give it a color manually via a gradient.  The
    identifier should probably be between 0 and 1.

    A better alternative to the identifier might be to get something
    equivalent via a solid noise function, though.

    The coordinates should probably be three-dimensional.

Okay.  Well, part of the talk was about how some of Escher's
patterns with shapes that diminish towards the centre of the
plane are just mathematical transformations of simple
Euclidean patterns.  I demonstrated this fact by carrying
the transformation out on a couple of patterns.  You can see
the results here:

        http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/tmp/butterflies.png
        http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/tmp/butterflies_merc.png
        http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/tmp/snakes.jpg
        http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/tmp/snakes_merc.png

For reference, the transformation is to put the coordinate 
axes of the complex plane at the center of the circular picture
and to pass the image through the function f(z)=log(z) in
the complex plane.  More precisely, I used this function in 
MathMap:

#+BEGIN_SRC mathmap
y = y/H*360.0*1.6;
cy = cos( ay );
sy = sin( ay );
ax =-0.8+(x+X)/W*9;
ex = exp( ax );
mx = ex*cy;
my = ex*sy;

ssx = mx*3;
ssy = my*3;

** GIMP Plug-In
*** DONE The main input image can be overwritten			:bug:
    CLOSED: [2009-08-22 Sat 13:04]
    Copying over uservals from one filter to the next even overwrites
    the first image userval if the names match.  This is an issue if
    the new filter names its first input image after a non-first input
    image of the last filter.
** Designer
*** DONE The Sharp-Blur filter can't be loaded into the expression db	:bug:
    CLOSED: [2009-08-23 Sun 12:55]
*** DONE Filters can be included twice					:bug:
    CLOSED: [2009-08-23 Sun 12:23]
    When a sub-designer-filter includes a filter and the main filter
    (or probably some other sub-filter) uses them, too, they are
    included twice.  See Blur->Sharp Blur.
*** DONE make order of inputs in composer deterministic		    :feature:

** Filters
*** DONE Dissolve doesn't work properly					:bug:
    CLOSED: [2009-08-22 Sat 14:15]
    It probably shouldn't be a pixel filter, and the opacity control
    misses the 0 and 1 marks.
*** DONE Remove "Addition with Opacity Native"

** Compiler
*** DONE Make min/max builtins use min/max ops	       :performance:simplify:
    CLOSED: [2009-08-16 Sun 16:56]
*** DONE The compiler should complain when two filters have the same name :bug:
    CLOSED: [2009-08-23 Sun 12:00]
*** DONE We still have some bugs in the coordinate transformations	:bug:
    CLOSED: [2009-08-16 Sun 23:17]
    This does not work as expected if the aspect ratios of in1 and in2
    are different:

    #+BEGIN_SRC mathmap
    filter bla_ident (image in)
      in(xy)
    end

    filter bla (image in, image in2)
      bla_ident(in2,xy)
    end
    #+END_SRC

    It turns out the problem here is that closures get their pixel
    size from their first image, which is wrong.  It should always be
    the same for all closures, namely the canvas size.
*** DONE Still still bugs in the coordinate transformations		:bug:
    CLOSED: [2009-08-22 Sat 11:13]
    Doesn't work if the two images have different aspect rations:

    #+BEGIN_SRC mathmap
    stretched filter util_ident (stretched image in)
      in(xy)
    end

    filter __composer_filter__ (image comp_burn_in1, image util_ident_in)
      util_ident(util_ident_in, xy)
    end
    #+END_SRC

    Actually no, this isn't a bug, but a consequence of our
    half-hearted coordinate transformation fixes.  The stretched ident
    filter now hands coordinates straight through to its input image,
    but the coordinate it gets are in the aspect ratio of the main
    filters first input image.
*** DONE Profile the compilation of Gaussian Blur->Spin Zoom->Droste :performance:
    CLOSED: [2009-08-16 Sun 00:24]
    Most of the time is spent in GCC compiling the C code.  Without
    the backend we compile in 0.4s, with the GCC backend in over 3s.
    Just compiling the C code on the command-line takes about 2.5s.
    With LLVM we're much faster - about 0.8s including the backend.
*** DONE Gaussian Blur->Droste still has some loop issues		:bug:
    CLOSED: [2009-08-15 Sat 22:16]
Will be solved by [[*caching of native filter results]].
*** DONE Gaussian Blur->Spin Zoom->Droste crashes			:bug:
    CLOSED: [2009-08-15 Sat 22:59]
So does Gaussian Blur->Random Blur->Droste
